Add these features to the existing website:

Donations Module

Volunteers can donate directly to any cause.

NGOs must have a dashboard to analyze donations visually using:

Graphs

Charts

Trend analytics

Category-wise and time-wise donation breakdown

Include filters like: date range, cause, donation amount

Prepare system for payment gateway later, but for now build donation storage and analysis only.

Fix “My Tasks” Error

When a volunteer clicks My Tasks (/my-tasks) or a specific task card, an error appears.

Debug and fix it by ensuring:

Tasks load correctly from backend

No null/undefined task IDs are passed

The task details page opens without crashing

Proper error handling + fallback UI if data is missing

Add logs to detect the root cause and ensure task click always routes to a valid task page.

Community Blogs Section

Create a Blogs area (/community) where:

NGOs can post updates, announcements, stories, or community messages.

Posts must support: images, videos, and text together.

Feed layout should feel like a social media post system.

Add ability for volunteers to also post in the same section.

Each post must allow:

Uploading media (images/videos)

Writing captions/text

Sharing links

Auto timestamp and profile name

Community Posting System

Both NGOs and volunteers can create posts similar to social media:

Media + caption + text

Scrollable feed

Likes and share buttons (optional)

NGO posts can also include: impact achievements, donation appeals, awareness content.

Donation Analytics Visualization

NGO dashboard must include:

A section: Donation Insights

Visual graphs for total donations, weekly/monthly trends, and cause-wise performance

A clean, professional analytics layout

Rules to Maintain

Keep UI clean, professional, and well-structured

Ensure frontend passes valid IDs and data only

Fix crashes with proper error boundaries and fallback messages

No payments integration now, but database must be ready for it later

No hardware or blockchain — software only
