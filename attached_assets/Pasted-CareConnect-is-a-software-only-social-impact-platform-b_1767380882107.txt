CareConnect is a software-only social impact platform built using (Rocket) backend + React.js frontend for seamless NGO–Volunteer collaboration. CareConnect is a website that helps people do social work together in an organized way.

NGOs/organizations post real community problems (like food drives, education support, animal care, women welfare, etc.)

Volunteers browse those causes, choose what matches their interest, and apply to help

Once accepted, volunteers get tasks, update progress, and upload proof of their work

NGOs review the proof and approve it, so only genuine work counts

The website also tracks impact (how many causes solved, how many volunteers helped), making social work transparent and efficient

Later, a donation/payment system can be added to support causes financially

In short:

CareConnect connects helpers to causes, avoids duplicate efforts, and makes sure real impact is created and verified.Here is your **highly efficient, phased, consistent, AI-ready prompt** to build **CareConnect** (software only, social cause) using **Rust + Rocket backend** and **React/Next.js frontend**, with clean UI/UX and future payment readiness.

You can paste this exactly into your AI/LLM or teammate chat:

### **CareConnect – Full-Stack Development Prompt**

You are a senior full-stack engineer AI. Build **CareConnect**, a software-only platform for NGO and volunteer collaboration.

Follow these principles:

* **Backend = Rust using Rocket**
* **Frontend = React or Next.js**
* **Communication = JSON REST APIs**
* **Security = JWT + bcrypt + role-based access**
* **MVP first, payments later**
* **UI must be clean, professional, grid-based, minimal, modern**
* **No hardware or blockchain**

---

---

## **🧱 Phase 1 – Project Setup**

### Backend (Rocket, Rust)

1. Create a new Rocket Rust project
2. Enable async support
3. Add dependencies for:

   * JWT auth
   * bcrypt hashing
   * database ORM (SQLx or Diesel)
   * CORS handling
4. Set up environment variables for:

   * Secret key
   * Database URL
5. Create folder structure:

```
src/
├ main.rs
├ routes/auth.rs
├ routes/causes.rs
├ routes/tasks.rs
├ models/user.rs
├ models/cause.rs
├ models/task.rs
├ db.rs
├ utils.rs
```

### Frontend (Next.js preferred)

1. Initialize project
2. Use **Tailwind CSS**
3. Use a **minimal, social-impact focused theme**
4. Use fonts like: `Inter` or `Poppins`
5. Create folder structure:

```
app/
├ page.js (Landing)
├ login/page.js
├ signup/ngo/page.js
├ signup/volunteer/page.js
├ dashboard/ngo/page.js
├ dashboard/volunteer/page.js
├ cause/[cause_id]/page.js
├ task/[task_id]/page.js
├ components/
```

---

---

## **🔐 Phase 2 – Authentication System**

### Backend Tasks

1. Create:

   * `POST /api/auth/signup/ngo`
   * `POST /api/auth/signup/volunteer`
   * `POST /api/auth/login`
2. Hash passwords using **bcrypt**
3. Generate JWT token after signup/login:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

4. Include `role` and `user_id` inside JWT payload
5. Protect all NGO/Volunteer routes by validating JWT

### Frontend Tasks

1. Build login UI with role toggle (NGO/Volunteer)
2. On submit:

```
fetch("/api/auth/login", {method: "POST", body: {email, password, role}})
```

3. Store returned JWT token in `localStorage`
4. Redirect:

   * NGO → `/dashboard/ngo`
   * Volunteer → `/dashboard/volunteer`

## **📣 Phase 3 – NGO Cause Posting**

### Backend Tasks

1. Create cause endpoints:

   * `POST /api/causes/create`
   * `GET /api/ngo/causes/{ngo_id}`
   * `GET /api/causes/open?category=&location=&urgency=`
2. Cause table fields:

```
cause_id, ngo_id, title, description, category, location, urgency, status, created_at
```

3. Default `status = open`, `urgency = 0` if not provided

### Frontend Tasks

1. Build cause posting UI
2. On submit:

```
fetch("/api/causes/create", {headers: {Authorization: Bearer <token>}})
```

3. Show list of posted causes on NGO dashboard in grid

---

---

## **🔍 Phase 4 – Volunteer Cause Discovery & Apply**

### Backend Tasks

1. Create:

   * `GET /api/causes/open`
   * `POST /api/tasks/apply/{cause_id}`
   * `GET /api/ngo/applications/{ngo_id}`
2. Task/Application table fields:

```
task_id, cause_id, volunteer_id, status, proof_url, approved, updated_at
```

3. Default: `status = pending`, `approved = false`

### Frontend Tasks

1. Build cause discovery page
2. Display cause cards:

```
{title, NGO name, category, location, urgency badge, Apply button}
```

3. On Apply click:

```
POST /api/tasks/apply/{cause_id}
```

---

---

## **🧾 Phase 5 – Task Progress & Proof Upload**

### Backend Tasks

1. Create:

   * `PATCH /api/tasks/update/{task_id}`
   * `POST /api/tasks/proof/upload/{task_id}`
   * `POST /api/tasks/approve-proof/{task_id}` (for NGO)
2. Store proof URL or base64 image path
3. Update task status to `completed` only after NGO approval

### Frontend Tasks

1. Build `/task/{task_id}` page:

   * Checklist
   * Status dropdown
   * Proof upload
2. Proof upload sends:

```
POST /api/tasks/proof/upload/{task_id}
```

3. NGO reviews and approves → updates `approved = true`

## **📊 Phase 6 – Impact Tracking System**

### Backend Tasks

1. Create:

   * `GET /api/impact/stats`
2. Stats must calculate:

   * Total NGOs
   * Total volunteers
   * Causes completed
   * Volunteer hours/tasks solved
3. Return JSON

### Frontend Tasks

1. Show stats on landing page
2. Build impact feed (`/impact`) later if needed

## **🎨 Phase 7 – UI/UX Theme Definition**

Design rules:

* **Primary Color:** Deep navy or NGO-friendly teal (professional, soft, clean)
* **Layout:** Grid-based cards with rounded corners, soft shadows
* **Tone:** Professional, mission-driven, modern
* **UX Must Include:**

  * Clear redirects
  * Toast messages for API success/fail
  * Consistent spacing and padding
  * No clutter
  * Minimal icons (lucide-react optional)

Pages must feel like: **Trustworthy, clean, social-impact focused, internship-ready**

---

---

## **💰 Phase 8 – Future Payment Planning (Not Now)**

Prepare system to add later:

1. Donation page UI
2. DB column:

```
amount_raised (int, default 0)
```

3. Reserve API route:

```
POST /api/donate/{cause_id}
```

Payment gateways (Razorpay/Stripe/UPI) will be added **after MVP works end-to-end**

---

---

## **🌍 Phase 9 – Frontend ↔ Backend Secure Communication**

Every frontend API call must:

1. Send JWT in headers for protected routes
2. Handle JSON only
3. Follow this pattern:

```
fetch("/api/route", {
   method: "POST/GET/PATCH",
   headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "Authorization": "Bearer <token>"
   },
   body: JSON.stringify(data)
})
```

Backend must always:

* Validate token
* Return JSON + proper HTTP status codes

---

---

## **Final Expected Deliverables**

1. Fully working Rocket backend APIs
2. Connected Next.js frontend pages
3. Secure role-based routing
4. Proof upload + approval workflow
5. Impact stats endpoint
6. Clean professional UI
7. Payment-ready DB schema (no integration yet)
